# TestRobot2022

## What is this project?
This FIRST Robotics project contains the code for Team 7358's robot for the 2022 FRC competition. It is free to repurpose and modify for yourself, although I'm not sure you would want to. XD

## What does it do?
We are currently testing and creating swerve drive for the 2024 season, but the robot will get a full code update soon

## Plans for future iterations of the code
We hope to pass on the knowlege gained from past members to avoid mistakes and create a consistient viable robot.

## Versions:
2.0.0 First ever version for team 7538 with swerve drive! (hopefully it goes well)

## Contributors:
Anthony Pinzon (lead coder), Chat GPT, and hopefully some new recruits that will be named

Nolan (Graduated past lead coder, included for past contributions to programming)

## Contact:
You can email Anthony here: anthonytpinzon@gmail.com or locate Mrs. Jenkins' email through the Mountain View High School (Lawrenceville, GA) website's staff directory.
Either way, we'd love to collaborate with other FRC teams!
